% code to process microSWIFT IMU measurements 
% 
% Inputs are raw accelerometer, gyro, and magnotometer readings (3 axis each)
% along with magnetometer offsets (3), a weight coef for filtering the gyro, 
% and the sampling frequency of the raw data
%
% raw data are 2048x1 doubles, other inputs are 1x1 doubles
%
%   [ Hs, Tp, Dp, E, f, a1, b1, a2, b2, check ] = processIMU(ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz, mx, my, mz, mxo, myo, mzo, Wd, fs );
%
% Outputs are significat wave height [m], dominant period [s], dominant direction 
% [deg T, using meteorological from which waves are propagating], spectral 
% energy density [m^2/Hz], frequency [Hz], and 
% the normalized spectral moments a1, b1, a2, b2, 
%
% Outputs will be '9999' for invalid results.
%
% The input weight coef Wd must be between 0 and 1, with 0 as default 
% (this controls importantce dynamic angles in a complimentary filter)
%
% The default magnetomoter offsets are mxo = 60, myo = 60, mzo = 120
%
% The sampling rate is usually 4 Hz
%
% The body reference frame for the inputs is
%   x: along bottle (towards cap), roll around this axis
%   y: accross bottle (right hand sys), pitch around this axis
%   z: up (skyward, same as GPS), yaw around this axis
