Configuration file for the microSWIFT wave bouy.

-----------------------------
Duty Cycle Length
-----------------------------
The length of time of the total duty cycle. The duty cycle is defined 
as the total time for both the record and send windows for the 
microSWIFT. The duty cycle is defined in units of MINUTES. It must be 
an integer value. Default value is 60 minutes.

duty_cycle_length = 60

-----------------------------
Record Window Length
-----------------------------
The length of time that the instruments will be recording. This time 
MUST be shorter than the defined length of the duty cycle. The record
length is defined in units of MINUTES and it must be an integer value.
Default value is 50 minutes.

record_window_length = 59

-----------------------------
GPS Sampling Frequency
-----------------------------
The sampling frequency of the GPS. This is the rate at which the GPS 
will sample during the record window. The gps sampling frequency is
defined in units of HZ (samples/second). This value can range from 
1 to 4 Hz. This value must also be an integer. Default value is 4 Hz.

gps_sampling_frequency = 4

-----------------------------
IMU Sampling Frequency
-----------------------------
The sampling frequnecy of the IMU. This is the rate at which the IMU 
will sample during the record window. The imu sampling frequency is 
defined in units of HZ (samples/second). This value can range from
1 to 30 Hz. This value must also be an integer. Default value is 12 Hz.

imu_sampling_frequency = 12
