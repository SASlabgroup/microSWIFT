How to Run microSWIFT.py in the background:

Enter to following commands into the file /etc/rc.local to run at boot

cd /home/pi/microSWIFT
python3 -u microSWIFT.py >> onboardlog.txt &

* The -u flag makes it so that the print statements are unbuffered and so they do not print to the terminal even when running in the background. 

To view the onboardlog.txt in real time use the command: tail -F onboardlog.txt, to exit from this view use the keyboard shortcut ctrl-c

getting the following error on occasion: 

UnboundLocalError: local variable 'gpgga' referenced before assignment
 
- it doesnt happen all the time but it does need to be addressed as a possible failure mode 

SBD notes:

installed the termianl program screen using the command: "sudo apt install screen"
this is used to test the modem based on this article: https://learn.adafruit.com/using-the-rockblock-iridium-modem?view=all

Random Notes: 
installed ipython to test some of the python functionality more onboard rather than within the python interpreter
