# microSWIFT
UVic's version of the buoy has some signicicant changed to the original
design:
- our version takes data more or less all the time
- our version uses a commercial radio used commonly in drones to transmit
  measurements back to the (nearby) user

For more information on the UVic version of the microSWIFT buoy, see
