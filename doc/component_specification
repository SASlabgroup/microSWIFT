## Hardware Components

### Raspberry Pi

At the heart of the microSWIFT is a Raspberry Pi Zero. This developer-friendly board, combined with easy-to-read Python-based code, makes the microSWIFT an effective tool for ocean wave research and student learning. An obvious tradeoff, however, is its high power consumption compared to that attainable with an embedded microcontroller and code.

### GPS

The GPS module is a GlobalTop FGPMMOPA6H provided on an Adafruit Ultimate GPS v3 breakout board. It provides the time, position, and velocity  datastreams to the microSWIFT. The last known position of the microSWIFT is reported to the server during every duty cycle as latitude and longitude in decimal degrees. The North and East doppler velocities are fundamental input to the onboard wave processing algorithms.

### IMU

The inertial measurement unit (IMU) is comprised of a 3-axis digital gyroscope (FXAS21002C) and a 6-axis integrated linear accelerometer and magnetometer (FXOS8700CQ), both provided on an Adafruit Precision NXP 9-DOF Breakout Board. The combined IMU measurements can be transformed, numerically integrated, and used to provide an alternative heave estimate in the wave processing.

## Design Diagram

Process flow is controlled by `microSWIFT.py` module. At boot-up, `microSWIFT.py` is executed by `microSWIFT.service`. It then instantiates the `logger`, `Config`, `GPS`, and `IMU` objects and enters the record-process-send loop which runs indefinitely. Each loop is defined as one duty cycle. This is sequencing is summarized in the following flow chart:

    class start darkgreen

```

### Initialization window

The initialization window is run once per boot. It instantiates  `logger`, `Config`, `GPS`, and `IMU` objects based on the user-defined configuration settings in `config.txt`. It also sets the defining window times, including the start of the duty cyle (= start of the `record window`), the end of the recording window, and the end of the duty cycle (note that the length of `send window` = a full duty cycle - `record window`).

```mermaid

    subgraph initialization["initialization window"]
        direction TB
        logger["initialize logger"]
        config-->gps["initialize GPS"] & imu["initialize IMU"] & set_time["set current window start and end times"];
    end

    classDef blue fill:#a4ccf5,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px

    class initialization,user_config grey
    class logger,config,gps,imu,set_time blue
```

### Record window

A record window is entered when the current time is between the start and end record window times, as determined by `Config`. Its main task is to power on the GPS and IMU, record them concurrently using `concurrent.futures`, and then power them down. The `record()` method of both `GPS` and `IMU` writes data to `.dat` files stored onboard.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph record_window["record window"]
        direction TB
        gps_on["power on GPS"] --> imu_on["power on IMU"] --> futures
        subgraph futures["concurrent.futures"]
            direction TB
            record_gps["record GPS"]-->gps_data[(gps data)]
            record_imu["record IMU"]-->imu_data[(imu data)]
        end
        futures --> gps_off["power off GPS"] --> imu_off["power off IMU"] --> return([return])
    end

    classDef green fill:#d4f5a4,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
    classDef grey fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#a3a0a0, stroke-width:1px
    classDef red fill:#f7b2b2, stroke:#a3a0a0, stroke-width:1px

    class gps_on,imu_on,record_gps,record_imu,gps_data,imu_data,gps_off,imu_off green
    class record_window,futures grey
    class return, red

```

### Processing window

The processing window reads the previously recorded `.dat` files from the `GPS` and `IMU`  into memory, transforms the data into the appropriate coordinates, and produces a wave estimate based on the configured wave processing type. If the required data streams do not pass quality control, the payload is filled with bad values to be sent along with any remaining available data.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph processing_window["processing window"]
    direction TB
    type{"processing type"} -->|"gps waves"| gps_good{"gps passes<br/>quality control?"}
        gps_good-->|yes| gps_to_uvz["transform (lat,lon) to (u,v)"]
            gps_to_uvz-->gps_waves[run gps_waves]
        gps_waves-->return
        gps_good-->|no| fill_bad_values["fill with bad values"]

    type{"processing type"} -->|"uvza waves"| gps_and_imu_good{"imu & gps pass<br/>quality control?"}
        gps_and_imu_good-->|no| fill_bad_values["fill with bad values"]

        gps_and_imu_good-->|yes| transform_imu_and_gps["transform (lat,lon) to (u,v) <br/> integrate imu to (x,y,z)"]
        transform_imu_and_gps-->uvza_waves["run_uvza_waves"]
        uvza_waves-->return


    fill_bad_values --> return([return])
    end

    classDef yellow fill:#f5f5a4,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
    classDef grey fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#a3a0a0, stroke-width:1px
    classDef red fill:#f7b2b2, stroke:#a3a0a0, stroke-width:1px
    
    class processing_window grey
    class type,gps_good,gps_and_imu_good,gps_to_uvz,gps_waves,fill_bad_values,transform_imu_and_gps,uvza_waves yellow
    class return, red

```

### Send window

In the send window, the payload is packed into a binary short burst data (`.sbd`) file and pushed onto a stack of messages to be sent. Until the duty cycle is up, or if the stack empties, messages are repeatedly read from the top of the stack and sent to the server. If a message fails to send, the loop continues to try to send it until the time expires.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph send_window["send window"]
    direction LR
        pack["pack payload<br/>and push to<br/>telemetry stack"]-->in_send{"still in<br/>send window?"};
        in_send-->|yes| send["send from<br/>top of stack"];
            send-->send_successful{"send<br/>successful?"}
                send_successful-->|yes| update_stack["update<br/>stack"]
                    update_stack-->all_sent{"all messages<br/>sent?"}
                    all_sent-->|yes| return([return])

                    all_sent-->|no| in_send

                send_successful-->|no| in_send

        in_send-->|no| return
    end

    classDef orange fill:#f5d4a4,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px
    classDef grey fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#a3a0a0, stroke-width:1px
    classDef red fill:#f7b2b2, stroke:#a3a0a0, stroke-width:1px
    class send_window grey
